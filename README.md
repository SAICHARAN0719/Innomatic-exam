Project Overview

    This project involves the analysis of a movie dataset consisting of several CSV files, which include information about movies, user ratings, tags, and movie links. The goal is to explore and gain insights into movie performance based on user ratings, identify popular movies, and analyze trends across genres. Additionally, the project includes scraping IMDb for reviews related to popular movies.

Dataset Structure

    The dataset consists of the following CSV files:
        movies.csv: Contains information about movies, including movieId, title, and genres.
        ratings.csv: Contains user ratings for movies, including userId, movieId, rating, and timestamp.
        tags.csv: Contains user-generated tags for movies, including userId, movieId, tag, and timestamp.
        links.csv: Contains external identifiers for movies such as IMDb and TMDb IDs (movieId, imdbId, tmdbId).

Key Steps and Analysis

    Loading the Data:
        The dataset is loaded into Python using the pandas library. Each CSV file is read into a DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

    Aggregating Ratings:
        The ratings data is aggregated by movieId to calculate the count of ratings and the average rating for each movie. This allows us to identify movies with the highest ratings and the most number of ratings.

    Identifying Popular Movies:
        The project analyzes the most popular movies based on both the number of ratings and the average rating. Movies with the highest counts and the best average ratings are identified.

    Tagging Analysis:
        The tags.csv file is used to explore the user-generated tags for specific movies. This helps to identify themes or genres commonly associated with particular movies.

    Movie Rating Distribution:
        A visualization is generated for the distribution of ratings for a particular movie. This helps to understand how users perceive the movie and how ratings are spread across different rating values.

    Filtering and Merging Data:
        Movies with a rating count higher than a threshold (e.g., 50 ratings) are filtered to focus on movies with significant user feedback.
        The ratings and movie data are merged to provide a complete view of the movies, including their genres, average ratings, and number of ratings.

    Scraping IMDb Reviews:
        Using the IMDb movie IDs from the links.csv file, the project scrapes movie reviews from IMDb for selected popular movies. The requests and BeautifulSoup libraries are used to gather and parse the review data from IMDb pages.
        This step provides additional qualitative insights into how users feel about the movies based on their reviews.

    Genre-Based Analysis:
        The dataset is filtered to focus on specific genres, such as Sci-Fi. This allows for genre-based analysis, helping to identify the most popular movies within a particular genre based on user ratings and reviews.

Tools and Libraries Used

    Pandas: For data manipulation, aggregation, and merging.
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization, specifically for plotting rating distributions.
    Requests: For sending HTTP requests to IMDb and retrieving page data.
    BeautifulSoup: For parsing and extracting information from IMDb pages.
    Time: For handling delays between scraping requests to avoid overloading the IMDb servers.

Conclusion

    This project provides an in-depth exploration of a movie dataset through statistical analysis, visualization, and web scraping. By aggregating user ratings, identifying popular movies, and analyzing genre-specific trends, the project offers insights into movie performance and user preferences. The integration of IMDb reviews enhances the analysis by adding qualitative data to the quantitative ratings.
